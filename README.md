## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these SQL queries, you need access to a SQL-compatible database. Note that this repository does not include any databases, so you will need to set one up yourself. You can use platforms like [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) for practice or set up a local database using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), or any other relational database management system (RDBMS).

### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kyoriku/sql-zoo.git
```

To run the queries, open the `.sql` files with your preferred SQL editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) or [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), and execute the queries against a database.
