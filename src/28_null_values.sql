-- Selecting NULL values.
-- Sometimes NULL values are given in tables, this might be because the data is unknown or is inappropriate. In the Parliament database a NULL value for party in the MSP table indicates that the MSP concerned is not a member of any of the parties. In the party table a NULL value is used where the party does not have an official leader - or I couldn't find one. I rather like it that the Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party don't seem to have leaders - and it suits my purposes.
-- We can use the phrase IS NULL to pick out fields. We can use IS NOT NULL similarly.

-- 1. The SELECT statement returns results from a table. With a WHERE clause only some rows are returned. This example shows the year that Athens hosted the Olympic games.
SELECT code, name FROM party
  WHERE leader IS NULL
