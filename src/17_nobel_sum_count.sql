-- https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_nobel_table_can_be_used_to_practice_more_SUM_and_COUNT_functions.

-- This tutorial concerns aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM and AVG.

-- 1. Show the total number of prizes awarded.
SELECT COUNT(winner)
  FROM nobel

-- 2. List each subject - just once
SELECT DISTINCT subject
  FROM nobel

-- 3. Show the total number of prizes awarded for Physics.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner) 
SELECT COUNT(winner)
  FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Physics'

-- 4. For each subject show the subject and the number of prizes.
-- nobel(yr,subject, winner) 
SELECT subject, COUNT(winner)
  FROM nobel
 GROUP BY subject

-- 5. For each subject show the first year that the prize was awarded.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner)  
SELECT subject, MIN(yr)
  FROM nobel
 GROUP BY subject

-- 6. For each subject show the number of prizes awarded in the year 2000.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner)  
SELECT subject, COUNT(winner)
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 2000
 GROUP BY subject

-- 7. Show the number of different winners for each subject. Be aware that Frederick Sanger has won the chemistry prize twice - he should only be counted once.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner)
SELECT subject, COUNT(DISTINCT winner)
  FROM nobel
 GROUP BY subject

-- 8. For each subject show how many years have had prizes awarded.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner) 
SELECT subject, COUNT(DISTINCT yr)
  FROM nobel
 GROUP BY subject

-- 9. Show the years in which three prizes were given for Physics.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner) 
SELECT yr
  FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Physics'
 GROUP BY yr
HAVING COUNT(winner) = 3

-- 10. Show winners who have won more than once.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner)  
SELECT winner
  FROM nobel
 GROUP BY winner 
HAVING COUNT(winner) > 1

-- 11. Show winners who have won more than one subject.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner)  
SELECT winner
  FROM nobel
 GROUP BY winner
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT subject) > 1

-- 12. Show the year and subject where 3 prizes were given. Show only years 2000 onwards.
-- nobel(yr, subject, winner)  
SELECT yr, subject
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr >= 2000
 GROUP BY yr, subject
HAVING COUNT(winner) = 3
