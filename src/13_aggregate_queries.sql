-- https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Using_SUM,_Count,_MAX,_DISTINCT_and_ORDER_BY

-- Aggregates
-- The functions SUM, COUNT, MAX and AVG are "aggregates", each may be applied to a numeric attribute resulting in a single row being returned by the query. (These functions are even more useful when used with the GROUP BY clause.)

-- Distinct
-- By default the result of a SELECT may contain duplicate rows. We can remove these duplicates using the DISTINCT key word.

-- Order by
-- ORDER BY permits us to see the result of a SELECT in any particular order. We may indicate ASC or DESC for ascending (smallest first, largest last) or descending order.

-- 1. The total population and GDP of Europe.
SELECT SUM(population), SUM(gdp)
  FROM bbc
 WHERE region = 'Europe'

-- 2. What are the regions?
SELECT DISTINCT region
  FROM bbc

-- 3. Show the `name` and `population` for each country with a population of more than 100000000. Show countries in descending order of population.
SELECT name, population
  FROM bbc
 WHERE population > 100000000
 ORDER BY population DESC
