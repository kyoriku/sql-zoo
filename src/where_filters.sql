-- 1. The population of 'France'. Strings should be in 'single quotes';
SELECT population FROM bbc
  WHERE name = 'France'

-- 2. The names and population densities for the very large countries. We can use mathematical and string expressions as well as field names and constants.
SELECT name, population/area FROM bbc
  WHERE area > 5000000

-- 3. Where to find some very small, very rich countries. We use AND to ensure that two or more conditions hold true.
SELECT name, region
  FROM bbc
  WHERE area < 2000
    AND gdp > 5000000000

-- 4. Which of Ceylon, Iran, Persia and Sri Lanka is the name of a country? The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list.
SELECT name FROM bbc
  WHERE name IN ('Sri Lanka', 'Ceylon', 'Persia', 'Iran')

-- 5. What are the countries beginning with D? The word LIKE permits pattern matching - % is the wildcard.
SELECT name FROM bbc
  WHERE name LIKE 'D%'

-- 6. Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking - note that it is inclusive.
SELECT name, area FROM bbc
  WHERE area BETWEEN 207600 AND 244820

-- SELECT attribute-list
--    FROM table-name
--    WHERE condition
-- attribute-list
  -- This is usually a comma separated list of attributes (field names)
  -- Expressions involving these attributes may be used. The normal mathematical operators +, -, *, / may be used on numeric values. String values may be concatenated using ||
  -- To select all attributes use *
  -- The attributes in this case are: name, region, area, population and gdp
-- table-name
  -- In these examples the table is always bbc.
-- condition
  -- This is a boolean expression which each row must satisfy.
  -- Operators which may be used include AND, OR, NOT, >, >=, =, <, <=
  -- The LIKE operator permits strings to be compared using 'wild cards'. The symbols _ and % are used to represent a single character or a sequence of characters. Note that MS Access SQL uses ? and * instead of _ and % .
  -- The IN operator allows an item to be tested against a list of values.
  -- There is a BETWEEN operator for checking ranges.
